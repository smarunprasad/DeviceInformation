# DeviceInformation
     
    This application is developed using the Swift launguage and used to test the DeviceKit &amp; CryptKit with API call
    
     
# Approach
     
     Init the CryptKit with key we are having.
     
     Created the 2 buttons (Start & Reset), 3 labels , 3 images for Status & Textview to load the data.
     
     While tab on the Start button it calls the DeviceKit to get the device info.
     
     Then converted it to the Encrypted formate.
     
     Then pass the data to the deviceinfo in the custom object in the HTTPBody.
     
     Call the Customer API & print the response in the log.
     
     
 # Result
 
     In the textview it print all the status changes.
