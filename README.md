# DeviceInformation
     
    This application is developed using the Swift launguage and used to test the DeviceKit &amp; CryptKit with API call
     
# Approach

     Init the CryptKit with the given key

     Created  2 buttons (Start & Reset), 3 labels , 3 images for Status & Textview to load the data.

     On tab the start button it will start reading  deviceInfo of the device which is being used and returns deviceInfo and encrypt it. 

     While tab on the Start button it calls the DeviceKit to get the device info.

     Then converted it to the Encrypted formate.

     pass the encrypted data to the deviceInfo in the custom object in the HTTPBody.

     Called the Customer API & printed the response in the log.

 # Result

     It logs as much as data for investigation.
